                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Kobe Bryant</b> was born in Philadelphia, the youngest of three children and 
                    the only son of former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant. He was also the maternal 
                    nephew of NBA player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, 
                    Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's 
                    nickname "Jellybean." Bryant's family was Catholic and he was brought up with this faith.<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bryant started playing basketball when he was three, and the Lakers were his 
                    favorite team when he was growing up. When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and 
                    moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball. After two years, 
                    they moved first to Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became accustomed to
                    his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia, 
                    which he considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made. 
                    Bryant began to play basketball seriously while living in Reggio Emilia. Bryant's grandfather would 
                    mail him videos of NBA games for Bryant to study. Another source of inspiration was animated European 
                    films about sports, from which he learned more about basketball. He also learned to play soccer and 
                    his favorite soccer team was A.C. Milan. During summers, Bryant would come back to the United States 
                    to play in a basketball summer league. When Bryant was 13, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia, 
                    where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.<br>
