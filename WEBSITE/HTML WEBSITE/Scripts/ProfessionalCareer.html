                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Before the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against 
                    former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and, according to then-Laker manager Jerry
                    West, "marched over these people".<br><br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a player's draft rights 
                    to free up salary cap space to make an offer to free-agent center Shaquille O'Neal. Bill Branch, 
                    the Charlotte Hornets' head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their 
                    No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement, the Hornets 
                    never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select 
                    minutes before the pick was made. Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. 
                    After the draft, the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be 
                    traded from Los Angeles. However, on June 30, Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made 
                    final on July 9, 1996, when the league's off-season moratorium ended. Since Bryant was still 17 at 
                    the time, his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers until he was able to sign his own 
                    when he turned 18 before the season began. Bryant signed a three-year rookie contract totaling $3.5 million.
