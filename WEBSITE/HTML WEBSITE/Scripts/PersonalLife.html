                    Bryant was the youngest of three children. He grew up with two older sisters, Sharia and Shaya, 
                    and had a close relationship with them until his death.<br><br>

                    In November 1999, 21-year-old Bryant met 17-year-old Vanessa Laine while she was working as a 
                    background dancer on the Tha Eastsidaz music video "G'd Up". Bryant was in the building and 
                    working on his debut album. The two began dating and became engaged six months later in 
                    May 2000, while Laine was still a senior at Marina High School in Huntington Beach, California. 
                    To avoid media scrutiny, she finished high school through independent study. 
                    According to Vanessa's cousin Laila Laine, there was no prenuptial agreement. 
                    Laila said Bryant "loved her too much for one".<br><br>

                    They married on April 18, 2001, at St. Edward the Confessor Catholic Church in Dana Point, 
                    California. The wedding was not attended by Bryant's parents, his two sisters, his longtime 
                    advisor and agent Arn Tellem, or his Laker teammates. Bryant's parents were opposed to the 
                    marriage for a number of reasons. Reportedly Bryant's parents had problems with him marrying 
                    so young, especially to a woman who was not African-American.This disagreement resulted in an 
                    estrangement period of over two years, which ended when the couple's first daughter was born.<br><br>

                    The Bryants' first daughter, Natalia, was born in January 2003. The birth resulted in a 
                    reconciliation between Bryant and his parents. Due to an ectopic pregnancy, Vanessa suffered 
                    a miscarriage in the spring of 2005. Their second daughter, Gianna Maria-Onore 
                    (also referred to as "Gigi"), was born in May 2006. On December 16, 2011, Vanessa Bryant
                    filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences, and the couple requested joint custody 
                    of their daughters. On January 11, 2013, Bryant and his wife both announced via social media 
                    that they had called off their divorce. In early December 2016, Vanessa gave birth to their 
                    third daughter, and in January 2019 the Bryants announced they were expecting a fourth daughter. 
                    Their daughter was born in June 2019.<br><br>

                    Bryant was a practicing Catholic. He said his faith and a priest helped him through difficult 
                    times, such as the period following his accusation of rape. A Catholic cantor said she was 
                    inspired by Bryant's faith, and the respect that he showed her. Bryant and his family were 
                    regular attendees at Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church in Newport Beach. Bryant and 
                    his daughter, Gianna, received the Eucharist together just hours before they died.<br><br>

                    Bryant was multilingual. He was fluent in English, Italian and Spanish. Bryant assigned himself 
                    the nickname of "Black Mamba", citing a desire for his basketball skills to mimic the eponymous 
                    snake's ability to "strike with 99% accuracy at maximum speed, in rapid succession." During the 
                    2012â€“13 season, he began referring to himself as "vino" to describe how his play had been aging 
                    like a fine wine.

                    In January 2002, Bryant bought a Mediterranean-style house for $4 million, located on a 
                    cul-de-sac in Newport Coast, Newport Beach. He sold the house in May 2015.<br><br>

                    In 2013, Bryant had a legal disagreement with an auction house over memorabilia from his early 
                    years that his mother had put up for auction. Bryant's mother received $450,000 from the auction 
                    house for the items, and contended Bryant had given her the rights to the items he had remaining 
                    in her home. However, Bryant's lawyers asked the auction house to return the items. Before the 
                    scheduled trial, a settlement was reached allowing the auction house the sale of less than 10% 
                    of the items. Bryant's parents apologized to him for the misunderstanding in a written statement, 
                    and appreciated the financial support he had given them over the years.<br><br>

                    Bryant was a lifelong fan of his hometown NFL team, the Philadelphia Eagles. He was also a fan 
                    of soccer teams Barcelona, AC Milan, and Manchester City.<br><br>

                    According to Forbes, Bryant's $680 million in career earnings was the most ever by a team 
                    athlete during their playing career.<br><br>

                    He is also a second cousin of his former Lakers teammate Cedric Ceballos.<br><br>
