                    Bryant was called "one of the greatest players in the history of our game" by NBA commissioner Adam 
                    Silver, and The New York Times wrote that he had "one of the most decorated careers in the history 
                    of the sport." Reuters called him "arguably the best player of his generation", while both Sporting 
                    News and TNT named him their NBA player of the decade for the 2000s. In 2008 and again in 2016, 
                    ESPN ranked him the second-greatest shooting guard of all time after Jordan. Players including Kevin 
                    Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, and Derrick Rose called Bryant their generation's version of Jordan. 
                    The Press-Enterprise described Bryant as "maybe the greatest Laker in the organization's history". 
                    He was the Lakers' all-time leading scorer, and his five titles are tied for the most in franchise 
                    history. Both numbers he wore during his career, 8 and 24, were retired by the Lakers on December 18, 2017. 
                    In his first year of eligibility, Bryant was named a finalist for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of 
                    Fame, weeks after his death, before being elected a couple of months later in April 2020. His formal 
                    induction was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Bryant was honored as one of 
                    the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.<br><br>

                    With career averages of 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.4 steals per game, 
                    Bryant was considered one of the most complete players in NBA history. He is the fourth-leading 
                    scorer in league history with 33,643 points. He was the first player in NBA history to have at 
                    least 30,000 career points and 6,000 career assists, and was one of only four players with 
                    25,000 points, 6,000 rebounds, and 6,000 assists. Bryant led the NBA in scoring during the 
                    2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. His 81-point performance against Toronto in 2006 was the 
                    second-highest in NBA history, behind only Chamberlain's 100. He scored at least 50 points 
                    24 times in his career, which is third in league history behind Jordan (31) and Chamberlain (118);
                    [ six times Bryant scored at least 60. He was just the third player in NBA history to average 
                    40 points in a calendar month, which he accomplished four times.[h] Bryant was voted the league 
                    MVP in 2008 and led his team to the 2008 NBA Finals as the first seed in the Western Conference. 
                    In the 2008 Summer Olympics, he won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. men's basketball team, 
                    occasionally referred to as "The Redeem Team". He won another gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. 
                    He led the Lakers to two more championships in 2009 and 2010, winning the Finals MVP award on 
                    both occasions.<br><br>
